# Distance Sensing Arm Prosthetic
The distance-Sensing arm is an edit of The UnLimbited Arm v2.1 - Alfie Edition by Stephen Robert Davies & Drew Murray / Team Unlimbited. Incorporating a distance Sensing and audio feedback system, it aims to aid those who have suffered limb loss or have limb birth defects and are also blind or partially sighted. This is a common occurance in Colombia due to the high number of land mine accidents.

Right now we are using a more precisely sensor wich works better with the UnLimbited Arm v2.1 and also is cheaper than SRF01. Also we have changed the Buzzer alarm to a vibrating motor.

To view a guide on how to manufacture this prosthetic with the SRF01 sensor, see [the wiki](https://github.com/enable-medellin/Distance-Sensing-Arm-Prosthetic-Prototype/wiki/MK1-Prototype).

To view the guide for the new design using the newest sensor and the vibrating motor, see the [Distance-Sensing-Arm-Second-Version](https://github.com/enable-medellin/Distance-Sensing-Arm-Prosthetic-Prototype/wiki/Second-Version).
