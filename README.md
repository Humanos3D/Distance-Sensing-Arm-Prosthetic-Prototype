# Distance Sensing Arm Prosthetic
The distance-Sensing arm is an edit of The UnLimbited Arm v2.1 - Alfie Edition by Stephen Robert Davies & Drew Murray / Team Unlimbited. Incorporating a distance Sensing and audio feedback system, it aims to aid those who have suffered limb loss or have limb birth defects and are also blind or partially sighted. This is a common occurance in Colombia due to the high number of land mine accidents.
